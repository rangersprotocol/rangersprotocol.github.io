subtitle: Global Expansion

---

Rangers Protocol Foundation reported that in November 2021, the Rangers Protocol Robin Testnet version is online. The Rangers Protocol promoted the development of Robin Testnet in the global market.

On November 4, 2021, the blockchain infrastructure Rangers Protocol officially released its Testnet Master version, Robin Testnet. Robin Testnet already possesses the main functions of Rangers Protocol’s mainnet — Rangers Engine and Rangers Connector. It provides test channels for both developers and users. 

The Rangers Protocol Foundation very much agrees with Rangers Protocol's expansion of global marketing. 

The Rangers Protocol Foundation has an 680.21 RPG backup funding support for the development of global marketing.  The funding includes activity costs to market the program, event costs, KOL rewards and other administrative costs.
