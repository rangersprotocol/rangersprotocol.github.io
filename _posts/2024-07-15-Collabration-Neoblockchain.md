Rangers Protocol Foundation reported that in June 2024, Rangers Protocol cooperated with Neo Blockchain, an open-source, community-driven blockchain platform designed to welcome developers into the Smart Economy.

The Rangers Protocol Foundation very much agrees with Rangers Protocol's construction of its global markets. Rangers Protocol Foundation supports MixMarvel's globalization strategy.

The Rangers Protocol Foundation provides 12,775 RPG financial support. The funding includes activity costs to market the program, event costs, KOL rewards and other administrative costs.
