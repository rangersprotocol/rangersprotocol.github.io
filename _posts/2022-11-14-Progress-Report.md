Rangers Protocol Foundation reported that in October 2022, Rangers Protocol released an updated Progress Report.

On October 2022, angers Protocol carried forward its work on technical development and ecosystem construction, with the Rangers Protocol mainnet operating stably and generating a total of 26.4 million blocks. The blockchain integration of Rangers Connector is proceeding smoothly, with 10% of work left to go. The 2.0 version of Node Management System is being developed based on new UI and page logic, which is currently half way through.
