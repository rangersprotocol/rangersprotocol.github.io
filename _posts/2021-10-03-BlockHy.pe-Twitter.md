Rangers Protocol Foundation states that reported in July 2021, the Rangers Protocol operation team will expand the global community through BlockHy.pe.

In July 2021, Rangers Protocol will cooperate with BlockHy. pe, a one-stop-shop for social media marketing, engagement and growth solutions.
Rangers Protocol expands global community users through multiple social media platforms such as Twitter, Telegram, Facebook, discord. Block. pe's cooperation was successful because more people got to know Rangers Protocol due to community influence. 

The Rangers Protocol Foundation very much agrees with Rangers Protocol's cooperation with BlockHy.pe. Rangers Protocol's community influence will help Rangers Protocol's developments and improvements.

The Rangers Protocol Foundation has 4,000 RPG backup funding support for the cooperation with BlockHy.pe. This is a long-term cooperation, and Rangers Protocol has a monthly budget for this program. The funding includes activity costs to market the program, event costs, KOL rewards and other administrative costs.
