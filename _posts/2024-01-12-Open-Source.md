Rangers Protocol Foundation reported that in December 2023, Rangers Protocol Officially Opens Source Code to the Public. 

This is a significant step forward for Rangers Protocol, as it demonstrates the projectâ€™s commitment to transparency and community-driven development. Open-sourcing the code will allow developers from all over the world to review, modify, and improve the Rangers Protocol codebase. This will help to ensure that the project is continuously evolving and improving, and it will also foster a strong and engaged community of developers.

The Rangers Protocol Foundation strongly supports the development of Rangers Protocol, helping Rangers Protocol improve its brand influence. 

The Rangers Protocol Foundation has an 4,361.23 RPG backup funding support for the development of technology.  The funding includes activity costs to market the program, event costs, KOL rewards and other administrative costs.
