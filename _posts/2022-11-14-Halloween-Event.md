Rangers Protocol Foundation reported that in October 2022, Rangers Protocol lauched Halloween-themed event in the global community.

On October 2022, a Halloween-themed event was launched in the Rangers Protocol community to boost the festive vibes and give back to the community members for their warm support all along. Anyone participating the event by posting short horror stories in the telegram channel of Rangers Protocol stood a chance to share the airdrop prize.

Rangers Protocol will stay attentive to its community and make it a loving and warming neighborhood.

The Rangers Protocol Foundation very much agrees with Rangers Protocol' Themed events launched in the global community.  

The Rangers Protocol Foundation has an 2,500 RPG backup funding support for the development of global community.  The funding includes activity costs to marketing program, event costs, KOL rewards and other administrative costs.
