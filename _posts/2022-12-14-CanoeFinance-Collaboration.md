On November 2022, Canoe Finance, a scenario-first MetaFi toolkit, recently announced its partnership with Multichain, the cross-chain router protocol, which allowed the Canoe DeFi plugin to integrate Multichain Protocol into Rangers Protocol. The one-stop DeFi solution on Rangers Protocol has been fully completed by Canoe Toolkit. The toolkit could help users in Rangers Protocol switch seamlessly between Web2 and Web3.
