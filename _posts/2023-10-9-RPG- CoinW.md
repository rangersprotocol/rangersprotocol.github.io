Dear Rangers Protocol Community,

We would like to bring to your attention an important matter regarding the $RPG price on CoinW. It has come to our attention that the price displayed on CoinW is incorrect. We would like to clarify that CoinW is not an exchange that we are currently cooperating with.

The accuracy of asset prices is of utmost importance to us, and we take the security of our users' assets very seriously. We urge all users to exercise caution and be vigilant regarding their asset security.

As always, Rangers Protocol Foundation is committed to providing a secure and transparent ecosystem for our community. We appreciate your understanding and cooperation during all times.

Best regards,

Rangers Protocol Foundation
