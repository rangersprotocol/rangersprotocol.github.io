On July 2022, Rangers Protocol reached strategic partnership with the non-custodial wallet UniPass, aiming to lower the usage threshold for vast dApp users on the Rangers Protocol network. Rangers Protocol has been providing technical support for Web3 core areas such as NFT, GameFi, and Metaverse. After cooperating with Unipass, users can enter Web3 applications through Web2 login methods, which lowers the threshold for users of Rangers Protocol and attracts more Web2 users into the Rangers Protocol ecosystem.

The Rangers Protocol Foundation very much agrees with Rangers Protocol's expansion of global community.  

The Rangers Protocol Foundation has an 5,354.75 RPG backup funding support for the development of global community.  The funding includes activity costs to market the program, event costs, KOL rewards and other administrative costs.
