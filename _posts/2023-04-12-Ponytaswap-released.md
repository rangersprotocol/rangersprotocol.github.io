Rangers Protocol Foundation reported that in March 2023, Rangers Protocol officially released the  PonytaSwap, next-gen DEX built for traders and gamers.

On March 2023, Rangers Protocol launched the first DEX Ponytaswap, as an all-powerful DEX tailored to Rangers Protocolâ€™s needs, facilitates fundamental price feeding and fulfills the prerequisite for game launch on Rangers Mainnet, both of which benefit the Rangers ecosystem greatly.

The Rangers Protocol Foundation strongly supports Rangers Protocol's global expansion strategy, helping Rangers Protocol improve its technology and releases. 

The Rangers Protocol Foundation has an 6,500.00 RPG backup funding support for the development. The funding includes activity costs to market the program, event costs, KOL rewards and other administrative costs.
