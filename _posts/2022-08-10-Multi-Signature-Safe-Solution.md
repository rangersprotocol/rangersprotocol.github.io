Rangers Protocol Foundation reported that in July 2022, Multi-signature safe Grand Guard officially lands on Rangers Protocol Mainnet.

On July 2022, Web3 Engine infrastructure Rangers Protocol announced the release of the newest component within its comprehensive toolset â€” the multi-signature safe Grand Guard, meant to help businesses and mass users to manage their blockchain assets on Rangers Protocol Mainnet. Grand Guard supports RAP-20 compatible FT/NFT assets and currently requires zero opening cost.

The Rangers Protocol Foundation very much agrees with Rangers Protocol's improvement of technology.
