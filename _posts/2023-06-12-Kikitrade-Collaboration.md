MixMarvel Foundation reported that in May 2023, MixMarvel is excited to announce a new partnership with Kikitrade, a highly influential SocialFi project supported by AnimocaBrands and EVG.

Kikitrade has emerged as a powerful force in the blockchain gaming space, enabling gamers to play and trade in-game items using cryptocurrencies. With a focus on GameFi and NFTs, Kikitrade has quickly become a popular platform among gamers.

The partnership between Kikitrade and MixMarvel is expected to benefit both platforms and accelerate the adoption of blockchain technology in the gaming industry.
