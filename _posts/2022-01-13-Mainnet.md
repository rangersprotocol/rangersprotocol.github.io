Rangers Protocol Foundation reported that in December 2021, the Rangers Protocol Mainnet was Launched.  The Rangers Protocol promoted the development of Robin Mainnet in the global market.

Rangers Protocol mainnet was officially launched on December 7, comprehensively supporting developers and users in NFTs and complex applications deployment as well as NFT cross-chain. It allows developers to freely create complex dapps through its highly scalable Rangers Engine and enables smooth interconnections with various public chains through its EVM-compatible bridge Rangers Connector.
