On December 2022, Rangers Protocol announced its partnership with MetaCene. MetaCene is a next-generation blockchain MMORPG homeland for mass players. With the game content deployed on Rangers Mainnet, MetaCene is expected to provide its community with an enjoyable gaming experience by leveraging Rangers Protocol’s mature and thoughtful design. The engine’s solid infrastructure will also assist MetaCene in realizing the truly “massively online” gameplay, reinforcing the game’s strong community attributes and helping to foster a sense of belonging among players. 

The Rangers Protocol Foundation very much agrees with Rangers Protocol's collaboration with MetaCene.  

The Rangers Protocol Foundation has an 689.27 RPG backup funding support for the development of global community.  The funding includes activity costs to market the program, event costs, KOL rewards and other administrative costs.
