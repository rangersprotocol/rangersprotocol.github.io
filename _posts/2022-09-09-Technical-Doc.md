Rangers Protocol Foundation reported that in August 2022, Rangers Protocol released an updated technical document introducing its Web3 Engine and the tools backed up by the Engine.

On August 2022, Rangers Protocol released its Updated Technical Doc. The document gave a comprehensive guide for accessing its services with a step-by-step illustrated instruction. It depicted the vision of an approachable Web3 future that Rangers Protocol strives to enable.

Rangers Protocol is the backbone of a Web3 Engine for creating immersive Web3 applications. It minimizes the development difficulty for Web3 developers and maximizes the user experience of its Web3 applications. Rangers Protocolâ€™s key features such as the VRF+BLS consensus module which facilitates a high-performing, stable and secure development environment, its Ethereum compatibility and cross-chain bridge solution which enables composability, usability and increases market interoperability, and the innovative waiting mechanism which adds temporality to the system; have all made contributions to a Web3 Engine prioritizing the developer and user experience, and had been well-explained in its recently released technical document.

The Rangers Protocol Foundation very much agrees with Rangers Protocol's devenlopment of technology.  

The Rangers Protocol Foundation has an 1,000 RPG backup funding support for the development of global community.  The funding includes activity costs to market the program, event costs, KOL rewards and other administrative costs.
